# Project Plan

## Title
cycling in Hamburg

## Main Question

1. How do weather conditions in Hamburg influence cycling traffic volumes as recorded by the City Cycling app, and can we identify any trends or patterns in cycling behavior related to changes in weather?

2. Considering the qualitative data on road usage by cyclists in Hamburg, have there been significant shifts in the cycling traffic volumes on certain roads or areas over the 3-week campaign period between 2018 and 2020, and how might these shifts correlate with weather conditions and infrastructural changes?

## Description
In urban environments, promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation is crucial for reducing congestion and carbon emissions. This project addresses the challenge of understanding cycling patterns and their relationship with weather conditions in Hamburg. By analyzing cycling volume data from the City Cycling app during a 3-week campaign period between 2018 and 2020, and correlating it with concurrent weather data, the project aims to uncover how climate factors influence cycling behavior.

Using statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the project will parse through the cycling volumes on Hamburg's roads, noting trends and changes possibly induced by weather variations or infrastructure developments. The results of this analysis are expected to provide insights into the effectiveness of cycling campaigns and infrastructure improvements. Furthermore, it could identify weather conditions that significantly deter cycling activity, guiding urban planners in creating more resilient cycling policies and infrastructure that encourage cycling regardless of weather. This endeavor not only serves the immediate needs of Hamburg's residents and policymakers but also contributes to broader environmental goals by fostering a deeper understanding of sustainable urban transport dynamics.

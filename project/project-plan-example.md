# Project Plan

## Title
Impact of air pollution in Bike Sharing at Seoul

## Main Question

1. How do air pollution in Seoul influence bike sharing traffic volumes as recorded, and can we identify any trends or patterns in cycling behavior related to changes in the air quality?

2. Considering the qualitative data on road usage by bike sharing in Seoul, have there been significant shifts in the cycling traffic volumes from 1/12/2017 to and 30/11/2018, and how might these shifts correlate with weather conditions and infrastructural changes?

## Description
In urban environments, promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation is crucial for reducing congestion and carbon emissions. This project addresses the challenge of understanding cycling patterns and their relationship with conditions in Seoul. By analyzing cycling volume data from 1/12/2017 to and 30/11/2018, and correlating it with concurrent weather data, the project aims to uncover how pollution and climate factors influence cycling behavior.

Using statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the project will parse through the cycling volumes on Seoul's roads, noting trends and changes possibly induced by weather variations or air pollution. The results of this analysis are expected to provide insights into the effectiveness of bike campaigns and infrastructure improvements. Furthermore, it could identify weather conditions that significantly deter cycling activity, guiding urban planners in creating more resilient cycling policies and infrastructure that encourage cycling regardless of weather. This endeavor not only serves the immediate needs of Seoul's residents and policymakers but also contributes to broader environmental goals by fostering a deeper understanding of sustainable urban transport dynamics.

## Datasources
